# About
This is a personal project inspired by the research paper "Neural Network based Inverse Kinematics Solution for Trajectory Tracking of a Robotic Arm" by Adrian-Vasile Duka. The full paper can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212017313006361?via%3Dihub). The goal was solve inverse kinematics using a feedforward neural network with only a single hidden layer.

In this project, I use Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and the [PincherX-100](https://docs.trossenrobotics.com/interbotix_xsarms_docs/specifications/px100.html) by Trossen Robotics.
